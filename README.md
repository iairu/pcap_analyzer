# Preparation for first run

## Setup virtual env.

Local environment for Python in root directory of this project:

```
python -m venv .
```

This way all PIP packages will be installed directly into the folder of choice and not globally, similar to Node.js projects.

**Make sure to activate your virtual environment** and check that it has properly activated on any new terminal in your project!

### Activation

After opening any terminal where you would like to work with the project (run, install packages, etc.), make sure to use an activation script:

​	**Windows CMD:** `Scripts\activate.bat`

​	**Windows PowerShell:** `Scripts\activate.ps1`

​	**Bash:** `source Scripts/activate`

### Activation check

If you aren't sure whether the virtual environment has activated using the methods above in your current terminal instance use:

```
where pip
```

Which should point you to *./Scripts/pip*. If it doesn't, try running another activation script in the folder. Same thing goes for `where python`, ...

### VSCode auto-activate

Then VSCode setup of Python local environment that will guarantee auto-activation of venv on all subsequent new terminal instances:

> Ctrl+Shift+P - Select interpreter - Select Interpreter path - *Open the ./Scripts/python (generated by venv) directory*

## Package dependencies

Package installation recommended AFTER virtual env. setup and activated (*check using `where pip`*), as not to saturate your global packages.

```
pip install scapy[complete]
```

Not all of the aforementioned packages are used in their entirety, but they're available just in case.

### Package version check

In case of incompatibilities, detailed information about package versions in `requirements.txt` generated using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`. 

Most of these packages are installed as dependencies automatically.
